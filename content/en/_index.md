bio: |
  With over 20 years in tech, I design and architect high-performance 
  distributed systems. I've built production systems in Go and led engineering teams—including 
  AI agents as full participants in the process. I speak at conferences and have been at 
  Kinescope for over 7 years, where I serve as CTO.
